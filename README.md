# mergerfs-tools

Optional tools to help manage data in a mergerfs pool.

## INSTALL

All of these suplimental tools are self contained Python3 apps. Make sure you have Python 3 installed and either run `make install` or copy the file to `/usr/local/bin` or wherever you keep your binarys and make it executable (chmod +x).

## TOOLS
### mergerfs.ctl

A wrapper around the mergerfs xattr interface.

[Download latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools/master/src/mergerfs.ctl)

```
$ mergerfs.ctl -h
usage: mergerfs.ctl [-h] [-m MOUNT] {add,remove,list,get,set,info} ...

positional arguments:
  {add,remove,list,get,set,info}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -m MOUNT, --mount MOUNT
                            mergerfs mount to act on
$ mergerfs.ctl info
- mount: /storage
  version: 2.14.0
  pid: 1234
  srcmounts:
    - /mnt/drive0
    - /mnt/drive1
$ mergerfs.ctl -m /storage add path /mnt/drive2
$ mergerfs.ctl info
- mount: /storage
  version: 2.14.0
  pid: 1234
  srcmounts:
    - /mnt/drive0
    - /mnt/drive1
    - /mnt/drive2
```

### mergerfs.fsck

Audits permissions and ownership of files and directories in a mergerfs mount and allows for manual and automatic fixing of them.

It's possible that files or directories can be duplicated across multiple drives and that their metadata become out of sync. Permissions, ownership, etc. This can cause some strange behavior depending on the mergerfs policies used. This tool helps find and fix those inconsistancies.

[Download latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools/master/src/mergerfs.fsck)

```
$ mergerfs.fsck -h
usage: mergerfs.fsck [-h] [-v] [-s] [-f {manual,newest,nonroot}] dir

audit a mergerfs mount for inconsistencies

positional arguments:
  dir                   starting directory

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose         print details of audit item
    -s, --size            only consider if the size is the same
    -f {manual,newest,nonroot}, --fix {manual,newest,nonroot}
                          fix policy
$ mergerfs.fsck -v -f manual /path/to/dir
```

### mergerfs.dup

Duplicates files & directories across branches in a pool. The file selected for duplication is picked by the `dup` option. Files will be copied to drives with the most free space. Deleted from others if `prune` is enabled.

See usage for more. Run as `root`. Requires `rsync` to be installed.

[Download latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools/master/src/mergerfs.dup)

```
usage: mergerfs.dup [<options>] <dir>

Duplicate files & directories across multiple drives in a pool.
Will print out commands for inspection and out of band use.

positional arguments:
  dir                    starting directory

optional arguments:
  -c, --count=           Number of copies to create. (default: 2)
  -d, --dup=             Which file (if more than one exists) to choose to
                         duplicate. Each one falls back to `mergerfs` if
                         all files have the same value. (default: newest)
                         * newest   : file with largest mtime
                         * oldest   : file with smallest mtime
                         * smallest : file with smallest size
                         * largest  : file with largest size
                         * mergerfs : file chosen by mergerfs' getattr
  -p, --prune            Remove files above `count`. Without this enabled
                         it will update all existing files.
  -e, --execute          Execute `rsync` and `rm` commands. Not just
                         print them.
  -I, --include=         fnmatch compatible filter to include files.
                         Can be used multiple times.
  -E, --exclude=         fnmatch compatible filter to exclude files.
                         Can be used multiple times.
```


### mergerfs.dedup

### mergerfs.consolidate

Consolidate **files** in a **single** mergerfs directory onto a **single** drive, recursively. This does **NOT** move all files at and below that directory to 1 drive. If you want to move data between drives simply use normal rsync or similar. This tool is only useful in niche usecases where the person wants to colocate files of their TV, music, etc. files onto a single drive *after the fact.* If you really wanted that you should probably use path preservation. For most people there is only downsides to using path preservation or colocating files.

Run as `root`. Requires `rsync` to be installed.

[Download latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools/master/src/mergerfs.consolidate)

```
usage: mergerfs.consolidate [<options>] <dir>

positional arguments:
  dir                    starting directory

optional arguments:
  -m, --max-files=       Skip directories with more than N files.
                         (default: 256)
  -M, --max-size=        Skip directories with files adding up to more
                         than N. (default: 16G)
  -I, --include-path=    fnmatch compatible path include filter.
                         Can be used multiple times.
  -E, --exclude-path=    fnmatch compatible path exclude filter.
                         Can be used multiple times.
  -e, --execute          Execute `rsync` commands as well as print them.
  -h, --help             Print this help.
```


### mergerfs.consolidate-dirs

Consolidate directories so that each of them only exists on one a single drive, recursively. The approach is that the tool loops through given directories, looks up the source drives, checks the space used per source directory, and moves the data from the smaller ones into the largest one. Ending with a single directory.

Requires `rsync` to be installed.

```
usage: mergerfs.consolidate-dirs [<options>] <dir>...

positional arguments:
  dir                    directory to consolidate, can be repeated

optional arguments:
  -v, --verbose          Verbose printing
  -e, --execute          Execute `rsync` commands as well as print them.
  -h, --help             Print this help.
```
